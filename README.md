# Fungus - 3D Demos

This project is a list of [Fungus](http://fungusgames.com/) demos originally created for the *Lab Game Design* course I held at [NABA](http://www.naba.it/) in 2017/2018.
Most of the examples have been created on student request or as a solution for some topics raised during lessons.

*Note that most of the examples are just prototypes and should not be considered complete products.*

## Scene List

*  **Fungus_BasicFlowchart**: a simple example on how to use the dialogue and branching system with a _Flowchart_.
